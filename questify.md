# turning daily tasks into grandiose quests
so i want to make an app. let's say you have a huge goal. let's say the goal is to publish a massive game that (hopefully) makes you a trillion dollars. let's call that the Grand Quest, the Grand Quest probably involves a Main Questline (making the game, marketing the game, getting sponsors, etc). now the Main Questline probably involves many quests, like making the assets, level design, sound design, etc etc. now the Grand Quest also prbably involves Side Quests that are optional but would enhance the overall Grand Quest. life would be much simpler if you were able to break every huge project and gamify it like this. it would also be cool if you were able to assign a set amount of xp to each quest (therby being able to quantify the importance of a particular quest). you can also classify different parts of the quest into "arcs". the coolest part of this project is the fact that you can breeak down a HUUUUGE goal into like daily tasks. 

small problem. i dont know how to make an android app.

ok so im going to be using kotline, not java, even though i know java better. most of the docs are in kotlin so im just fucked.

you know what would be a good idea? ill build a todo list app and then build on top of that. that would be a good idea. so lets just scrap the main page for now and make a todo list app and build the questline functionality on top of it. this would also teach me the basics of kotlin and android app development.

# learning c++ through leetcode because why not
i want to learn c++. if i were to hypothetically program competitively i would have to use java. beacuse thats the only language i know well. thats a bit of a problem because i have to type 100 lines to get and validate user inpput. learning c++ is better. and also i can flex.

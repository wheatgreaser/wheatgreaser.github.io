# analyzing market ineffiencies and making a gajillion dollars

ok. lets say you have a company that is worth 100 dollars per share right now, and people think the next product you launch (let's say the fabled airpods 3) will make a shitload of money so the value will be 120$ by the next month (when you launch the product). people aren't idiots. they can read the news, so everyone buys the stock while it is at 100 so the price starts to go up. the news is now priced in, i.e, the stock's market price is now 120$ so the stock already took the airpods 3 launch into the account. most things are already priced in. this is why investing in the short term is base idiocy. EVERYTHING IS PRICED IN. this is called the efficient market hypothesis. 

but there's a catch. sometimes, very rarely, very very very rarely, the public cannot forsee the exposure of the company to certain unpredictable events, i.e, they do not predict the risk correctly, mind you, 99.9999% of the time the public does predict the risk correctly, but sometimes, there is an inefficiency in the market. now, looking for these inefficiencies is what suited up assholes in goldman sachs and barclays do. so even then you are at a disadvantage. so why the fuck am i doing this. idk. 

so look, an inefficiency is like a goldmine, let's say the weather forcast is wrong for some region mexico where they do fishing or something, idk, and let's say because of the extreme heat the oil pipes require more maintainence and therefore lose like 3 pennies/gallon, so you use that information to make quite the fair sum. so what im going to be doing is collecting a list of predictions from several different fields from weather to politics (using a bot/web scraper), and then ill try to find ineffiencies using my human brain, and try to use those methods and put THAT in a bot. so this bot will find inefficiencies in the financial market. 

now there is a popular source of forecasts, idk if you've heard of it, its called the news and its apparently quite popular. now the news is huge, like if the news says the weather ini mexico in oct 25 is going to be 100 degrees it is most likely going to be true and most people will take it as fact and use that fact to make the commodity investment, now what i do is look a little bit deeper and make a prediction that NO it is not infact going to be 100 degrees but 105 degrees and boom, cost of oil/gallon will slightly increase and boom my futures contracts are worth a lot more.

DISCLAIMER: bro im not even investing real money into this, im just looking at hypotheticals. if the idiot who's typing this degenrate article doesn't trust his own analysis please don't invest on it.

ok. so first we need to find the value of the stock of a comapny. why? good question. basically let's say i predict the revenue of the company will drop by this much due to some external factor, i want to be able to look at that and say well because of the decrease in revenue, the value of the stock is going to decrease by this much. 

so we use something called a discounted cash flow to find the intrisic value of a stock. what we try to find if the money generated in the future is higher than what we invest right now. we can find the money generated by using this model. 

the premise of discounted cash flow is that the money you have right now is worth more than the money you have in the future because the money you have right now can be invested. lets say i invested 11 million dollars on a project and according to my estimation the projects returns me about 16 million dollars at the end of 5 years, by using discounted cash flow the adjusted return will be something like 13 million dollars, i.e, the returns coming in at the end of the 5 year period are worth less than the return in the end of the 1 year period because of the afforementioned money right now is worth more than the money in the future thing.

to predict the cash flows we need several data points, which i need to make, this is the part of the assessment that affects my analysis. like my idea of the growth rate vs what people think its going to be. okkkkkkk. so there's an excel sheet model that does this shit for us, we just need to plug in our assumptions and data from the company (that we can easily scrape from google finance). now i just need to build the news aggregator.

ok so im using the news api to get all the headlines, from like the past 10 days and im going to put in an excel sheet. then i can label it according to the category; like whether its weather predictions or like some news related to some political conflict.

let's say i wanted brain cancer, i can just look at all headlines related to bitcoin from the top articles with like a few lines of code.

damn this api is like super handy. this could be really useful for other projects in the future.

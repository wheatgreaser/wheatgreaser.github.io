# analyzing market ineffiencies and making a gajillion dollars

ok. lets say you have a company that is worth 100 dollars per share right now, and people think the next product you launch (let's say the fabled airpods 3) will make a shitload of money so the value will be 120$ by the next month (when you launch the product). people aren't idiots. they can read the news, so everyone buys the stock while it is at 100 so the price starts to go up. the news is now priced in, i.e, the stock's market price is now 120$ so the stock already took the airpods 3 launch into the account. most things are already priced in. this is why investing in the short term is base idiocy. EVERYTHING IS PRICED IN. this is called the efficient market hypothesis. 

but there's a catch. sometimes, very rarely, very very very rarely, the public cannot forsee the exposure of the company to certain unpredictable events, i.e, they do not predict the risk correctly, mind you, 99.9999% of the time the public does predict the risk correctly, but sometimes, there is an inefficiency in the market. now, looking for these inefficiencies is what suited up assholes in goldman sachs and barclays do. so even then you are at a disadvantage. so why the fuck am i doing this. idk. 

what we're going to be doing is called event based investing, i.e, to speculate the change of market on hte basis of real world events.

what im going to do is look at all the events in the past week and figure out how its going to influence the market. that is i want to gather all the news and assign it a value on in its influentialness, i.e, how much i think it is going to affect the price of a given stock. ill create an ml model that learns to predict this influentialness.
let's see how well the ml model does.

ok so im using the news api to get all the headlines, from like the past 10 days and im going to put in an excel sheet. then i can label it according to the category; like whether its weather predictions or like some news related to some political conflict.

let's say i wanted brain cancer, i can just look at all headlines related to bitcoin from the top articles with like a few lines of code.

damn this api is like super handy. this could be really useful for other projects in the future.

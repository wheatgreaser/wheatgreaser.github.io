wouldnt it be great if there was a system where you can be authorized as a 'guy' and the 'guy' is the only person who can see his own stuff. how sick would that be.

so here's the deal, i wanna do authentication and authorization. on supabase. thats like the whole thing. ok supabase makes it supa simple (see what i did there) to implement authorization, they have this system called RLS (row level security) you can basically modify who can see what rows based on their role, this is what we need.

# physics
i fucking love physics. like the compsci part of this "website" (work of art really) this is just a representation of my ideas of concepts, dont take them as fact, this is just how i understand physics to be.
the list of topics given below are topics that i am actively learning or have learnt (if it is marked done), dont use them as reference guides or something these ""posts"" are like journals, im just using this as a rubber duck.
ok. now that we have that out of the way.

## topics:
1. [quantum mechanics (yes really)](quantum_mechanics.md)

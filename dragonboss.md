# dragonsssss babyyyyy

ok, do you know about the placidusax fight from elden ring? NO? what the fuckkkkkk???? alright you can look it up [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xc5jJvPOeWo).
alrighty. so that looks sick as fuck right? i probably cant make something THAT fucking epic buuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuut i can make a dragon bossfight thats kinda fun and elden ringy. 

you see the biggest issue is the dragon and the player models, i dont know 3d modelling so we need to get creative. so my idea was to steal a free model from sketchfab or something and apply a ps2 shader on top of it so that i can claim that the shittiness is actually the intended effect. this is why i make the big bucks. 

so far i've worked on something quite rudimentary, a guy in a suit chasing the dragon, ive added lighting to the dragon but its still kind of obvious that the dragon mesh doesn't have any material applied on it. eh. we'll get to it later. ![alt text](/images/imagesfordragonfight/1.png)

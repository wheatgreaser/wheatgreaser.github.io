# reveamp maybe??
so i was reading this book called zen and the art of motorcycle maintainance, the book is about quality and shit. mostly shit. kidding, its actually a really good book, im not done with it tho, im like 70% through. the author talks about an inherent quality that can be percieved from, for example, an essay, that got my gears turning. churning even. grinding some call it. 

i also watched a youtube video on bland oversimmplified corporate-y shit. that also got my gears grinding.so yeah, a lot of grinding. so i wonder if i should revamp the style of the website, im quite fond the japanese websites, with their cramped aesthetic, so, maybe? but that requires doing css which im not so fond of. css makes my tummy hurt.

right now this website is just a bunch of markdown files held together by github page deployment thing. so there's that. that will take quite a bit of effort i think. so maybe?

ok revamp. ill strucute some shit out, but no promises ok?

i just got the virtual enivironments all setup. i got all the packages(package haha) installed. lets fucking do this. 

## 29 january, 2024:
do you even schema bro? i just learnt what schemas are. its so intuititive this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t) is great.
the thing i cant begin to comprehend is, why am i learning how to build apis? i dont even like web development but this is fun, i dont know why.
pydantic and postman are so useful. this is actually fun what the fuck?

CRUD is beginning to sound like a racial slur. it really does. BUT, i made a (sort of) fully functioning CR application (local memory , its just an array, not a database).
i hope i'll recieve my fields' medal once i complete the UD part. the part is till dont get is how this is going to be integrated into the front end.
how do you actually update the body of a POST request in front end, how do you actually display a GET request, HOW? i understand how it works with postman,
i also sort of get the backend part as to how the database might be implemented instead of an array in the local memory, but the frontend part is still a mystery,
i have faith that they will cover it later in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t)

THE CRUD IS COMPLETE. i actually did the UD part. the turing award is mine. the next part involves databases. im excited but i want to actually process, the stuff i learnt, so
im going on a side quest. new side project: library api. yes. you can add books and retrieve books (CR come on i dont wanna do the whole thing again, im not a masochist). if i do this side project i'll actually be
able to use what i learnt: schema, path parameters and exception handling. 
ok here's the repo for the [library api](https://github.com/wheatgreaser/library_api). 
i wanna build this api up (in the future) wiht frontend stuff(plain js and html). i also found out how frontend is integrated, we use something called FETCH api for javascript with that we can make
http requests. for making asynchronous requests (i'll find out what that means later) there is something called ajax. so yeah i wanna integrate frontend too. i want to make an actual completed website using apis and databases. it'll be great.

potgressqling begins. so i have a plan. im going to follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t) till the 5 and half hour mark (till the end of ORMs), then im gonna work on my project.
then ill return to it later if im interested.

postgress. it was easy. BUT I FUCKIGN FORGOT MY PASSWORD IN THE BEGINNING. i was sad. then i fixed it by deleting and reinstalling it. yes. this segment was actually really easy (i watched the tut in 2x speed) because i already knew SQL i learnt it like a year and a half ago so it was like a recap. after this part we're actually going to connect python with postgress HOW FUCKING INSANE IS THAT, if know how to do this part im practically a programming wizard. see, i already know html, css and vanilla js so using some random ass module i could make a HTTP request (lets say GET) then this is processed by FastAPI(which i already know the basics of), so now i could use python to get all the rows from the postgress server and return it, now the js recieves it in the json format, now i take that and display it, using html, css and basic js. BOOM. FULLSTACK BABY. IM SO FUCKING SMART. I SAFPJN FSKaf. i love computer science. im currently at the 4 hour mark (3 hours 50 mins to be exact), only about an hour and a half from my goal that i outlines in 31 jan. AFTER DOING THAT, i plan to return to this video and complete it tilllll the 7 and half hour mark. yes (they cover authentication and shit, ill probably get a new disrutpive idea by then). 
the parts after that, i dont think it will be useful for me as i stand right now, they cover deplyoment and migration WHICH IS SUPER IMPORTANT but not my primary focus right now.

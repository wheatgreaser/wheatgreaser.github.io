do you even schema bro? i just learnt what schemas are. its so intuititive this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t) is great.
the thing i cant begin to comprehend is, why am i learning how to build apis? i dont even like web development but this is fun, i dont know why.
pydantic and postman are so useful. this is actually fun what the fuck?

CRUD is beginning to sound like a racial slur. it really does. BUT, i made a (sort of) fully functioning CR application (local memory , its just an array, not a database).
i hope i'll recieve my fields' medal once i complete the UD part. the part is till dont get is how this is going to be integrated into the front end.
how do you actually update the body of a POST request in front end, how do you actually display a GET request, HOW? i understand how it works with postman,
i also sort of get the backend part as to how the database might be implemented instead of an array in the local memory, but the frontend part is still a mystery,
i have faith that they will cover it later in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t)

alright. im going to use react. why? because fuck you thats why. yeah im in my edgelord era(holy shit taylor swift reference????). no, the real reason im using react is cuz its also a cool(???) frontend framework which should give me the necessary skills to do that kind of web design work if i so desire. im going to try to implement the user authentiaction myself because i do know how to do that, read [this](apiing.md) if you need proof.

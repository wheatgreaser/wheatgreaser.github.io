alright. im going to use react. why? because fuck you thats why. yeah im in my edgelord era(holy shit taylor swift reference????). no, the real reason im using react is cuz its also a cool(???) frontend framework which should give me the necessary skills to do that kind of web design work if i so desire. im going to try to implement the user authentiaction myself because i do know how to do that, read [this](apiing.md) if you need proof. 

alright. so i am going to use expo to like test out my app, which is fun, the thing about react native is that i dont have to interact with the sweaty ugly android components, stupid xml and all that bullshit, its all hudden behinid an abstraction. now this also allows me to cross compile the same code to ios, so multiplatform functionality. that's neat. the problem is that this thing lacks performance.  this doesn't really matter because we're not really running any heavy duty application over here. i honestly expected react to be much worse because of all the fucking talk, you know? but its fine, for now? i guess im just beginning to understand various things so i've not really been exposed to its seedy underbelly.

i can explain. i can explain the delay. so im in this robotics club and i severly underestimated the diffculty of making a four legged thing move. yes. alright so where were we again? react native. alright so ive cooked up some fun functionality, i mean not physically, just ideas.
list of cool ideas:
### 1. trading card typa thing, you can trade your pets for other pets
### 2. pet casino where you can get some sweet sweet coins
### 3. ....

yeah thats about it. so for now ill just create a sweet little authentication and authorization system which will allow users to sign up and sign in. now hosting is kindof a problem as broke college freshie i cant afford aws and shit, i could do localhosting, that should be fun. ill cross that bridge when we come to that, but for now, only basic sign up and sign in functionality, ofc im going to be using jwt tokens, cuz, you know, ive used em before.

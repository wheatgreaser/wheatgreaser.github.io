# quantum mechanics
i know what qm is (thats what we call it in MIT, qm = quantum mechanics). this is going to be sort of math heavy. i am following the book [Quantum Mechanics: The Theoretical Minimum](https://theoreticalminimum.com/) by Leonard Susskind (among us reference holy fucking shit).
ok so im going to follow the book beginning to the end. im super excited.

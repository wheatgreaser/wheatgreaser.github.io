# creating a todo list app that modifies itself according to your mood
yup. 

### 31st December, 2024:
so the projects this year have been quite lackluster i know, but i promise big big big things are coming next year, i believe ill be elon musk next year. trust me guys. 
so a mood based todo list app. why did i do that? i wanted to learn react native thats about it. it taught me about hooks like useEffect, states, lifecycle of components, AsyncStrorage, context, callbacks and everything, i just rawdogged the project you know, didnt follow no tutorial or anything. neat huh? here's the final result (i didnt log the project because i just wanted to be done with it, like i focused on making the project first). so here's the final result:   
| Tables   |      Are      |  Cool |

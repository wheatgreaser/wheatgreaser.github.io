# making a game that will make billions of venezuelan bol√≠var

so im making a game. 

why?

to buy a maserati of course. 

ive decided to split the game into 2 segments, im aabout 25% of the way through for the first segent, so yes, quite a bit is done. what is the game about, you ask?
its about a guy with a 100k debt and a gambling problem. one of us. not the 100k debt part. I OWE THE IRS NOTHING. anywho, ill keep you (yes, you) updated about the progress here. 

you can play the sample of the game here (its online you lazy ass, so please just play it, it takes 0 effort, ok maybe not 0 effort but its close to 0, so please play it): [linky](https://wheatgreaser.itch.io/spirits-and-such-consultancy)

ok writing a devlog is way harder than you think. there is just so much shit i did, but when you type it out it looks like i wasted all my time wanking off. i DID NOT WASTE MY TIME I PROMISE.

ok the game is obviously a visual novel but with cool combat that steals/is inspired by undertale. i know that sounds generic as fuck but i promise the game is actually quite good. 

ok so the game isn't "technically challenging" but there are ascpects of the game that are very hard, for instance the art, the art is fun but also weirdly hard. the animation was mostly repetitive, like i just had to draw a few frames and basically modify the position of the sprites a bit. 

interestingly, i was able to desing a workable turn based combat system just by abusing a dialogue api that i poached from the godot marketplace. so there's that. 

what else? oh yeah thecombat mechanics aren't fixed the combat mechanism shown in the demo is one type of combat there's a a turn based pokemon style comabt that i added later on into the game, after that there's like a quiz/dating simulator style choose your adventure thing, so there's that. i need to add a gambling aspect to the game so it's lit. if it weren't for the fucking midsems i'll do it right now (ok that's just a stupid excuse, the real reason i dont want to make that part of the game is because it involves animating the slot machines and shit, and the difficulty scales with every gambling feature i add, for example, for poker i need to make a poker system, and a poker tutorial system for people who do not know how to play poker and after that i have to make specific assets and animations related to poekr and then i have to incorporate the gambling mechanism like the chips and shit and so on, game develoopment just scales exponentially by adding a "simple" feature you're quite literally trapping yourself, this is why im not adding poker to the game. im sticking to slots.)

the scaling problem in game development is so real tho, like i just thought whoa wouldnt it be fun if there was fun activities for the protagonists to do in weekends and now that fucking idea turned out to be a roadblock. but i love every second fo it, so i suppose that "fucking" idea was not so bad after all.

# making a game that will make billions of venezuelan bol√≠var

so im making a game. 

why?

to buy a maserati of course. 

ive decided to split the game into 2 segments, im aabout 25% of the way through for the first segent, so yes, quite a bit is done. what is the game about, you ask?
its about a guy with a 100k debt and a gambling problem. one of us. not the 100k debt part. I OWE THE IRS NOTHING. anywho, ill keep you (yes, you) updated about the progress here.

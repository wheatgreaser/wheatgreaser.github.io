# learning c++ because why not
i want to competitve programming. why? i dont know. but i want to. so i already know the satanic language colloquially known as java i can do some basic stuff like create stacks and queues and i can solve some basic competitive progragramming problems. but java is just so verbose. and c++ seems more chaddy (yes i watch a lot of tech youtube how did you know??). anywho i want to learn c++ from scratch.

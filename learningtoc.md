# learning c++ because why not
i want to competitve programming. why? i dont know. but i want to. so i already know the satanic language colloquially known as java i can do some basic stuff like create stacks and queues and i can solve some basic competitive progragramming problems. but java is just so verbose. and c++ seems more chaddy (yes i watch a lot of tech youtube how did you know??). anywho i want to learn c++ from scratch.

damn, [this guide](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/) is super helpful. i didnt know there were different types of initializations in c++. there's default initialization when you give no value, there's copy initialization (the one that we do like int a = 3) but apparently this commonly used one is slow?? the fuck. then there's direct initiaization which goes like int c (6); which is nuts. and then there's direct list intialization int d{7}; apparently this is the preferred way. we can also do it like int x = {3} which just looks like an array to me.

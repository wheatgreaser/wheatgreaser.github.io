# learning c++ because why not
i want to competitve programming. why? i dont know. but i want to. so i already know the satanic language colloquially known as java i can do some basic stuff like create stacks and queues and i can solve some basic competitive progragramming problems. but java is just so verbose. and c++ seems more chaddy (yes i watch a lot of tech youtube how did you know??). anywho i want to learn c++ from scratch.

damn, [this guide](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/variable-assignment-and-initialization/) is super helpful. i didnt know there were different types of initializations in c++. there's default initialization when you give no value, there's copy initialization (the one that we do like int a = 3) but apparently this commonly used one is slow?? the fuck. then there's direct initiaization which goes like int c (6); which is nuts. and then there's direct list intialization int d{7}; apparently this is the preferred way. we can also do it like int x = {3} which just looks like an array to me.

c++ is seems deceptively simple and then it uppercuts you with some bs.

i already know most of the basics of OOP i just want to just enough c++ syntaxc to do competitive programming, i dont want to know why using 
```
using namespace std;
```
is a bad idea. ill do a deep dive into the language later. just tell me how to do classes and objects and do arrays and enums. also pointers. fucking pointers. they're not even that complicated, is there some hidden jumpscare?? is there some freddy fazbear malenia blade of miquella phase 2 type of shit going on here?? because a pointer just contains the memory address of a variable and by derefeerencing a pointer by using the * keywrod we can just use the value in the address. is there more to it?? is my chain being jerked??

# making a boss fight for a game jam  
so i participated in the piratesoftware gamejam. it was fun.

so i made the game in godot cuz iv used it before and its a certified loverboy certififed pedophile ahh engine. idk why i said that, my brain is still not right, so the new things ive learned are: shaders, freezeframes, camerashit. yeah. 

## shaders  
this is not my first rodeo with the shader language and people overhyped its difficulty, its just changing colors of fragments during execution, ive fucked around a lil bit with opengl before so i knew what i was doing. and i just added a red hue to the player body when there is a collision, you maybe wondering "but oh oh how do you figure out wehre the player body begins and where it ends", its called UV mapping. idiot. get out here with your stupid fucking questions.

## freezeframes  
we basically slowdown the engine object. its that simple. i did run into a stupid fucking bug that fucked with the engine on scene change but eh i fixed it. im basically the ceo of stark industries tony stark billionaire playboy philanthropist at this point. 

## camerashit  
basically i want the scrren to vibrate when i hit the enemy, turns out there was conveninetly placed godot function for this, we just randomly generate vectors within the given range (according to "intensity") and provide a set duration. thats about it.

so i did actually manage to complete the project which is a solid W by all standards. you can check the game out here: https://wheatgreaser.itch.io/flail-v-slime

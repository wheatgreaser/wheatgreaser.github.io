chronicles of learning deeplearning (i'm chronicling so hard rn):  

i wanted to learn deep learning so that i could become a multi ultra mega zillion bajillionaire. no, really.
i learnt from the fundamentals(as one does). first principles are really important. i think. but i dont want to get swamped in the intricacies. i also want to learn the fun stuff.
i watched the 3blue1brown series(here's the [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)). it was so fucking godly. i semi-understood it the first time but still it was so fucking good.  
the thing is, i already knew a bit about deep learning, i read that book Artifcial Intelligence: A guide for Thinking Humans, so i went in with a bit of background.
i wanted to build a neural net from scratch. but i wanted to get used to the rough overview before going all in.

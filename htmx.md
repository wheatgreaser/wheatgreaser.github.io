# htmxing like a true G

# 26th july, 2024:
i want to make dynamic webpages, i just do, its just fucking awesome. htmx is cool because it follows a "hypermedia" approach, so it works with http requests, and im familiar with them, because, you know, [this](/apiing.md). html itself works with http requests, when you click a link you do a GET request that returns a html document which is pointed to by the link. htmx is just a js library that extends this functionality. this will complement my fastapi knowledge so i can make some wicked shit. hopefully. its super simple, when we request something from an api or give something to it its usually in JSON, now we just make it html, so when the "hx-get" tag requests from an endpoint the tag is just swapped with the html returned by the api.

# creating cronjobs to sync my markdown files
i have a massive organizational problem. i have obisidian on mobile and my pc, i thought it would automatically synchronize. i was mistaken. now im fucked. i have a plan though.

the plan is simple:
1. create a private github repo
2. continuously git push and pull from the private repo at lets say 2 hour intervals
3. ????
4. profit

its simple. the thing is, i dont know how cronjobs work let alone how to set it up in my android phone. this is going to be fun.

# why dont people build their own virtual cpus (are they stupid)

there are a few things that are over your skill level. you should always try then to improve your skills to that level, like beating a 1200 elo player in chess while youre still in 1000 elo. there are other things that are way over your skill level that you shouldnt even try; things that you cannot comprehend, like a 4 foot 1 middles school dweeb taking on lebron james. i am the metaphorical 4 foot 1 kid.

## november 22, 2023 - where do i even start:
i dont know man. i dont know anything about cpus. i think you misunderstand me, by i dint know anything i mean that i have like 0 knowledge, not even like a half assed knowledge. its sad, honestly. but feynman did say that the only way to know if you understand something is by creating. learning by creating bitches.

i found a starting point. im ecstatic. this [video](https://youtu.be/8XmxKPJDGU0?si=hESmnUutLE8t9HKD) is the fucking best. i love this. 

so basically a cpu has a clock, that tells it to perform a new step everytime the clock completes a cycle, then theres the cpu itself, which outputs the program counter(the address of the next program byte the cpu needs to read), then we get the instruction which can be 1 byte, 2 bytes or 3 bytes then we do some cpu magic then outputs data (if necessary) the cpu is connected to bus which in our case is connected to the ram. cpu cannot function as a single unit. 

tl;dr cpu is clocked, it sends program counter to bus, bus reads from ram and tells cpu the instructions, cpu does some cpu magic and if necessary sends the output to the bus. easy peasy lemon squeezy.

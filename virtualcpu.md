# why dont people build their own virtual cpus( are they stupid)

there are a few things that are over your skill level. you should always try then to improve your skills to that level, like beating a 1200 elo player in chess while youre still in 1000 elo. there are other things that are way over your skill level that you shouldnt even try; things that you cannot comprehend, like a 4 foot 1 middles school dweeb taking on lebron james. i am the metaphorical 4 foot 1 kid.(i have severe problem)

## november 22, 2023 - where do i even start:
i dont know man. i dont know anything about cpus. i think you misunderstand me, by i dint know anything i mean that i have like 0 knowledge, not even like a half assed knowledge. its sad, honestly. but feynman did say that the only way to know if you understand something is by creating. learning by creating bitches.

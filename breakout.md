# using raylib to make TETRISSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!

yoooooo. its time to move on from being a little soyboy bitch you know? i should stop working with sissy ass shit like fucking godot. I should use stuff that doesn't hand stuff to me on a fucking platter you know?

## march 30, 2024:
so raylib was easier than i thought. the thing is it provides with a lot of useful functions that just does stuff for you. so the project was easier than i expected.
the project turned out to be more of an exercise in OOP rather than actual game development. for instance, i created a seperate header file and a seperate cpp file for each component of the project. for example the grid, there is grid.h and grid.cpp, the grid.h is similar to an abstract class in java and grid.cpp is the actual class that does the stuff.

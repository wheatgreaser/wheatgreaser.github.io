# geometric encryption can beat quantum computers???

# 18/11/23:  

so here's the deal. can you encrypt shit using geometry, according to wikipedia, yes. ok but first, why would you want to encrypt using geometry. quantum computers. yeah. quantum compys can easily break rsa using shors algorithm, solution: geometry. i'm not the first guy to think of this (obviously). but i still wanna fuck around and learn a thing or two (god forbid 3).

# geometric encryption can beat quantum computers???

#### 18/11/23:  

so here's the deal. can you encrypt shit using geometry, according to wikipedia, yes. ok but first, why would you want to encrypt using geometry. quantum computers. yeah. quantum compys can easily break rsa using shors algorithm, solution: geometry. i'm not the first guy to think of this (obviously). but i still wanna fuck around and learn a thing or two (god forbid 3).

fuck. this is hard as fuck. i couldnt comprehend the trisection thing so i searched for something different and found a few papers on using ellipses for encryption. like tf?

ok turns out elliptic curve cryptography is actually popular. why is this shit so fucked.  nah.

im going to do my own thing, even if its shittier. but to do that i need to learn about cryptography. like a lot. until then this is going into the back-burner.

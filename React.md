# exploring the dark, sinister dungeon of React
i need to know frontend. i already know how to (sort of) work with apis and databases. i find my frontend skills severly lacking. people complain about javascript so much that ive internalised it and am avoiding it except for specific purposes (making get requests, taking the form data and sending it as a post, etc). i need to learn it. because if itll be really useful to know like 1 frontend library, you know? itll also be useful mobile app development (React Native baby). so its something i have to do. its a grind quest.

i set up a basic react project and added cdn links (yes the fast way shut up) and ran a ReactDOM.render() function. its super simple it takes two arguments the "html" "code" and the location.

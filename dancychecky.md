# is the song danceable tho?
cutting edge tech (not really but fuck you, i can say whatever i want) to predict if a song is danceable or not. 

## 20 november, 2023:

so i had a GBPP idea (genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, catch up libtards). you input the name of the song name and get the danceabbility. genius. heres the deal. i built the ml model. it is crap. i used linear regression and a shitty dataset that i stole off of kaggle. its like mixing lemonade and milk. 

i have to build the site. i built a base, a scaffolding, if you will using flask. all GBPPers use flask. i want to add css and everything. its going to be the next google/amazon/netflix/internet explorer. i love science. what why did i type that.

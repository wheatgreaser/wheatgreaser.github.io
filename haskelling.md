I'm the april fool. ok. the most important part of haskell is the lack of side effects, lemme explain, lets say you have a function f(x) that takes in x, suppose now you do some things to x and print it out, this is totally fine as long as you dont actually change the value of x itself (ex: x = x + 20). there are no side effects. this makes haskell super super safe to program in. the functions are kinda similar to mathematical functions, where you take in input and map it out to an output, and the function doesn't take the same input and map it out to two different outputs. also the function is defined throughout its domain (funnyFunc x = if x > 30 then x + 40 else x - 40), so this means that if you write an if statement it should have and else part.
